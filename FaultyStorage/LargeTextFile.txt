Valjean, at last,
We see each other plain
Monsieur le Maire
You wear a different chain!

Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me! There is something I must do.
This woman leaves behind a suffering child.
There is none but me who can intercede,
In Mercy's name, three days are all I need.
Then I'll return, I pledge my word.
Then I'll return

You must think me mad!
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man such as you.

(Men like you can never change)
Believe of me what you will
(Men like me can never change)
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do
(No,)
You know nothing of my life
(24601)
All I did was steal some bread
(My duty's to the law - you have no rights)
You know nothing of the world
(Come with me 24601)
You would sooner see me dead
(Now the wheel has turned around)
But not before I see this justice done
(Jean Valjean means nothing now)
I am warning you Javert
(Dare you talk to me of crime)
I'm a stronger man by far
(And the price you had to pay)
There is power in me yet
(Every man is born in sin)
My race is not yet run
(Every man must choose his way)

You know nothing of Javert
I was born inside a jail
I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter too!
